# Introduction

**MARS** is shortened for **Multi-Agent Research Studio**, a library for mulit-agent reinforcement learning research.

>*-If life exists on Mars, shall we human cooperate or compete with it?*

MARS uses PyTorch for most of its implementation, supporting multi-agent cooperative, competitive and mixed type games.
